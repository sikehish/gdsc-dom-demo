## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sikehish/gdsc-dom-demo.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd gdsc-dom-demo
    ```

3. Open the project in a Live Server:

   You can use a development server like Live Server in Visual Studio Code or any other development environment that supports live server functionality.
   Alternatively, if you have Python installed, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

   Or if you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package:

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server
    ```

   This will start a development server hosting your project. You can then access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000` or a similar address provided by the server.
